# Twitch-Directory-Cleaner
Allows the user to have a list of streams to remove from category directories

## How to install

Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), or whatever you want to use to load userscripts.

Then, click this link. Click install.

Once you do, you can see it in action by going to the category of your choice.


## Issues

- Currently only works if you load the category directly. Will fix
- Don't have all the channels listed. Either let me know on Discord (Artemis6425) or add them yourself by editing the script! Don't worry, I made it pretty straightforward.
