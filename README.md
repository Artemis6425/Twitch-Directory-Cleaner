# Twitch Directory Cleaner
Allows the user to have a list of streams to remove from category directories

The included array of streams to remove are 24/7 streams, primarily in the Super Mario 64 directory.


## How to install

Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), or whatever you want to use to load userscripts.

Then, click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Artemis6425/Twitch-Directory-Cleaner/refs/heads/main/twitch-directory-cleaner.user.js). Click install.

Once you do, you can see it in action by going to the category of your choice.

You can update easily by re-clicking that link, or at any point going to your extension, clicking the menu next to the script, and click "Update". It'll look for updates for you so you don't have to come back here.


## Issues

- Currently only works if you load the category directly. Will fix
- Doesn't include all of the 24/7 channels yet. Either let me know on Discord (Artemis6425) or add them yourself by editing the script! Don't worry, I made it pretty straightforward.


## Update plans

- Make it work without having to hard-refresh a page to get it to load
- Have options from using an array (like it is now) or by using an external link to use as a reference (so you could use somebody's else "block list", for example)
- Clean up code


## Changelog

### v1.0

- Initial Release

### v1.01

- Fixing update link in the script itself
